# s3 Sync Command

S3 sync compares the size of the file and the last modified timestamp to see if a file needs to be synced.

> ðŸ’¡ `aws s3 sync` looks at the destination before copying files over and only copies over files that are new and updated

```bash
aws s3 sync . s3://s3-bucket-name --exclude "*" --exclude "pre_build_script.sh" --include "config.toml" --include "gitlab-runners_userdata.sh" --size-only
```

`--exclude` (string) Exclude all files or objects from the command that matches the specified pattern.

`--include` (string) Don't exclude files or objects in the command that match the specified pattern.

`--size-only` (boolean) Makes the size of each key the only criteria used to decide whether to sync from source to destination.
